  <h2>create an account</h2>
  
  <p>
    Create an account to get access to our collectives' internet resources.

  <p>
    Creating an account is the first step towards becoming a fully-fledged
    member. Depending on which collectives you choose to join, additional
    steps will be involved. Please ask to find out what those steps are.

      You can always join more collectives later, or leave the ones you joined,
      but this system is of no use to you if you don't associate your account
      with at least one collective.

      I want to let
      <select name="visibility">
        <option value="everyone">everyone</option>
        <option value="accounts">anyone with an account</option>
        <option value="members">members only</option>
      </select>
      see my account.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Once you've created an account, you can add more authentication mechanisms.
    We are also open to communication methods other than email, but we need a
    working email address in order to get in touch initially. If you do not
    have an email address you're willing to provide, please come to a meeting
    so we can discuss other options in person.
